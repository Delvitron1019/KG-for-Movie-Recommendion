# JPKG
The implementation of "Jointly Learning Propagating Features on the Knowledge Graph for Movie Recommendation" (JPKG).

The attention learning module and multi-hop propagation module of JPKG achieve attention-based multi-hop propagation feature learning by recursively calculating the different contributions of neighbors on the graph. The mutual learning module of JPKG combines the entity embeddings learned from the two aforementioned modules to help provide more accurate recommendations.

It is the optimization of "Knowledge Graph Enhanced Multi-Task Learning between Reviews and Ratings for Movie Recommendation" (KMRR).
